        <div class="xyz">
            <div class="cc">
            <p class="abc"> Communication is simply the act of transferring information from one place, person or
                group
                to another.</p> <br>
            <p class="cv"> Every communication involves (at least) one sender, a message and a recipient. This may
                sound
                simple, but communication is actually a very complex subject.</p><br>

            <p class="vc">The transmission of the message from sender to recipient can be affected by a huge range
                of
                things. These include our emotions, the cultural situation, the medium used to communicate, and even
                our
                location. The complexity is why good communication skills are considered so desirable by employers
                around the world: accurate, effective and unambiguous communication is actually extremely hard.</p>

            <div class="cc">
                <strong>communication</strong>
                <em>n.</em>
                The imparting or exchanging of information by speaking, writing, or using some other medium. …The
                successful conveying or sharing of ideas and feelings.
            </div>

            </div>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <div class="nn">
                <p>As this definition makes clear, communication is more than simply the transmission of
                    information.
                    The term requires an element of success in transmitting or imparting a message, whether
                    information,
                    ideas, or emotions.</p><br>
                <p> <strong> A communication therefore has three parts: the sender, the message, and the
                        recipient.</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p> The sender ‘encodes’ the message, usually in a mixture of words and non-verbal communication. It
                    is
                    transmitted in some way (for example, in speech or writing), and the recipient ‘decodes’ it.</p>
                <br>

                <p> Of course, there may be more than one recipient, and the complexity of communication means that
                    each
                    one may receive a slightly different message. Two people may read very different things into the
                    choice of words and/or body language. It is also possible that neither of them will have quite
                    the
                    same understanding as the sender.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> In face-to-face communication, the roles of the sender and recipient are not distinct. The two
                    roles
                    will pass back and forwards between two people talking. Both parties communicate with each
                    other,
                    even if in very subtle ways such as through eye-contact (or lack of) and general body language.
                    In
                    written communication, however, the sender and recipient are more distinct.</p>

            <h2>Categories of Communication</h2> <br>
            <p> <strong>There are a wide range of ways in which we communicate and more than one may be occurring at
                    any
                    given time.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>The different categories of communication include:</p>

                        ways
                        that we communicate (perhaps even unintentionally) with others. For example, the tone of
                        voice
                        can give clues to mood or emotional state, whilst hand signals or gestures can add to a
                        spoken
                        message. </p>

            <h2>Process of Communication </h2><br>
            <p> Communications is a continuous process that mainly involves three elements viz. sender, message, and
                receiver. The elements involved in the communication process are explained below in detail:</p><br>

            <h3>1. Sender</h3><br>
            <p>The sender or the communicator generates the message and conveys it to the receiver. He is the source
                and
                the one who starts the communication</p><br>

            <h3> 2. Message </h3><br>
            <p>It is the idea, information, view, fact, feeling, etc. that is generated by the sender and is then
                intended to be communicated further.</p><br>

            <h3> 3. Encoding </h3><br>
            <p>The message generated by the sender is encoded symbolically such as in the form of words, pictures,
                gestures, etc. before it is being conveyed.</p><br>

            <h3> 3. Media </h3><br>
            <p>It is the manner in which the encoded message is transmitted. The message may be transmitted orally
                or in
                writing. The medium of communication includes telephone, internet, post, fax, e-mail, etc. The
                choice of
                medium is decided by the sender.</p><br>
            <br>
            <p class="vb"><em> "Learn more about <a href="#" class="bn"> Types of Communication here in detail</a>."
            </p>
            </em><br>
            <br>
            <h3> 5. Decoding</h3><br>
            <p>It is the process of converting the symbols encoded by the sender. After decoding the message is
                received
                by the receiver.</p>
            <br>

            <h3> 6. Receiver</h3><br>
            <p>He is the person who is last in the chain and for whom the message was sent by the sender. Once the
                receiver receives the message and understands it in proper perspective and acts according to the
                message, only then the purpose of communication is successful.</p>
            <br>
            <h3> 7. Feedback</h3><br>
            <p>Once the receiver confirms to the sender that he has received the message and understood it, the
                process
                of communication is complete.</p><br>
            <h3> 8. Noise</h3><br>
            <p>It refers to any obstruction that is caused by the sender, message or receiver during the <a href="#"
                    class="mk"> process of communication</a>. For example, bad telephone connection, faulty
                encoding,
                faulty decoding, inattentive receiver, poor understanding of message due to prejudice or
                inappropriate
                gestures, etc.</p><br>

            <h2>Importance of Communication</h2><br>
            <h3>1. The Basis of Co-ordination</h3><br>
            <p>The manager explains to the employees the organizational goals, modes of their achievement and also
                the <a href="#" class="zx">interpersonal relationships</a> amongst them. This provides coordination
                between various employees and also departments. Thus, communications act as a basis for coordination
                in the <a href="#" class="zx"> organization</a>.</p> <br>
            <h3>2. Fluent Working</h3>
            <p>A manager coordinates the human and physical elements of an organization to run it smoothly and
                efficiently. This <a href="#" class="zx"> coordination</a> is not possible without proper
                communication.</p>
